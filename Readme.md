### Game Modes:
**1. Play vs Player:** Choose this mode to play against another person.
Players take turns selecting their moves on the 3x3 grid.
**2. Play vs AI:** Choose this mode to play against the computer. 
The AI will automatically make its move after you select yours.

### Objective:
The goal is to align three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.

### Making a Move:
Click on any empty cell in the grid to place your symbol.
If you're playing against the AI, the computer will automatically take its turn after you.

### Winning the Game:
The game ends when one player successfully aligns three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).

### Restarting the Game:
Click the "Restart" button at any time to clear the grid and start a new game.
Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe, whether you're challenging a friend or testing your skills against the AI!
